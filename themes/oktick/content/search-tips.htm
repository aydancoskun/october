	Searching in 
	<strong>OKTicK</strong> is 'Simplicity Itself'.
</p>
<p>
	Type into the search line what you are looking for. The system will attempt to predict what you are looking for and list it out as you type.
	<br>
	<br>
	First thing it will recognise is 'Keywords' as you will no doubt see. If you go that route and select your Keyword it will list out the types of that item. Select from that list what you want and then Suppliers can be listed.
</p>
<p>
	Alternatively just type out your item. If it is on the system with suppliers currently it will be offered. Select it and 'Go!' for Suppliers.

	<u>Special Notes</u>
</p>
<p>
	a. 
	<strong>OKTicK</strong> concentrates on the “general" or “generic" names for items, not particular manufacturer's names or proprietary models. A provision for that is under preparation.
</p>
<p>
	b. Sometimes the very same thing can have several valid names. For example a 'Bicycle Pump' might also be called 'Cycle Pump', 'Bike Pump', 'Tyre Pump', or 'Foot Pump' etc and still be exactly what you are looking for. When listed from the Keyword these possibilities then present themselves, check it out.
</p>
<p>
	c. Expanding the item. If you select or type an item it might have many possiblities and these will then show. For example if 'Blue Dresses' was selected then other possibilities can also be selected such as Blue Prom Dresses, Blue Shirt Dresses, Dark Blue Dresses, Light Blue Dresses, Navy Blue Dresses, Royal Blue Dresses.
</p>
<p>
	d. Flexibility. Because the same stuff can have different names a system which helps you find different names for the same thing is vital. A little practice with OKTicK will demonstrate how to do this.
</p>
<p>
	e. Compound names. It's very common for something to be called by either of 2 spellings - same thing. Eg it could be <strong>Blackboards</strong> or <strong>Black Boards</strong>. You can check both if you need to.
