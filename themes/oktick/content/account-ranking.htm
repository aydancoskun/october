<p>This page gives you the possibility to elevate the listing position in the search by applying some credit to a product or service. The way this works is simple: When a person searches for your product or service you come up higher in the results listing depending on how many credits are applied. The company with applying more credits gets the higher position. You can puchase credits on the <a href="/account/credit">credits</a> page. The more credits you purchase the more advantageous they are priced. You apply credits to a product or service below by pressing the <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span></button> button. To remove credits applied press the <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus"></span></button> button. Credits are applied continuously until you set the credits to zero. Each week we will send you an email to let you know where your products and services stand.
</p>
<!--p>Another feature worth mentioning is the "booster" feature. If you enable this you will be able to achieve a much higher position than you could normally expect for the credit applied. The way it works is that we won't use your credit every time to push you up higher but only some of the time. The times we do use your credit, it will be more valuable for that instance.</p>
<p>An example will help to illustrate this: Lets say you apply one credit for one week using the booster. Instead of using your credit every time to push you up, we will - lets say - use your credit every 10th time to bring you up to the top. What the ratio is depends on the popularity of the item. This is our answer to help small companies to be able to get to the top of the list as well - just not every time.</p-->
<p>When you add or subtract credits you get refunded any amount of credits unused since a credit is valid for one whole week. So if you set your credits to zero half way through the week you'll be refunded half a credit. Similarly when you add credits to product which already has credits applied to it, you "join" their renewal date, so adding a credit might not cost you a whole credit but only half if you do it halfway through the week.
