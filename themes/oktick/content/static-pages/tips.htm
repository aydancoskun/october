	1.<strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">Keyword First</strong>. We suggest you start with the Keyword for the thing you are looking for eg “Table", “Printing", “Equipment" etc.
</p><p>
	Note: Once you have typed the first 2 letters of your <strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">Keyword</strong> the system will list out all 'Keywords' on the system beginning with those letters.&nbsp;</p><p>Eg. 'Ta' gives -&nbsp;Tablecloths,&nbsp;Tablemats,&nbsp;Tables,&nbsp;Taillights,&nbsp;Tailors,&nbsp;Takeaways etc&nbsp;<br><br>Once you have selected the Keyword you can start to find the specific type of that by pushing the '+' key and looking down the list presented or typing further letters.</p><p>Please bear in mind the names of the items listed are&nbsp;'non-proprietary' (generic or general) names. So there would&nbsp;<u data-redactor-tag="u">not</u>&nbsp;be&nbsp;“Jones Brothers&nbsp;Compressors" but “Gas Compressors" or "Air Compressors" etc.<br></p><p>2. <strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">Alternative approach</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just&nbsp;put in the item you are looking for&nbsp;in the "normal way"&nbsp;eg “Air Compressors" and if <strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">OKTicK</strong>&nbsp;have it listed then the system will bring up lists of suppliers for you.
</p><p>
	But in this case please note if you don't find the item with the precise&nbsp;name you have searched for&nbsp;it may still&nbsp;be on the system but under a slighly different name.<br>
	<br>3. <strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">Things that are d</strong><strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">ifferent name but still (essentially) the same thing</strong>.</p><p>We realise that the very same thing can have several valid names. For example a 'Bicycle Pump' might also be called 'Cycle Pump', 'Bike Pump', 'Tyre Pump', 'Foot Pump' etc and still could be exactly what you are looking for.
</p><p>
	Bearing this in mind, a search for one of <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">a particular name</em> may not always be fruitful but the item may be on the system under another (but quite valid) name. The system attempts to assist you to find those “alternatively named" items with suppliers as you will see when you use it.
</p><p>
	So called compound words are a special case. For example "Dartboards" may also be spelt "Dart Boards". On <strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">OKTicK</strong> we have tried to cover both possibilities.
</p><p>4. <strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">Miscellaneous Tips</strong>
</p><p>
	It is advisable to start anew if you are doing a brand new search. To do this click the '<strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">Clear</strong>' button.
</p><p>
	If at anytime the system seems to NOT be doing what you expect it to do you can “re-set" it by clicking the '<strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">Clear</strong>' button. <strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">OKTicK</strong> is very fast and can get you back to your search in seconds.
</p><p>Supplier's websites always open in a new window, leaving the list of suppliers on <strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">OKTicK</strong> still open so you can go back and select other Suppliers if you need to.</p><p>
	Some Keywords are a combination of 2 words, for example “Boxes for …", “Tins of ..." etc.
</p><p>
	Lastly, don't forget if you&nbsp;<a href="_register"><strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">Register</strong></a>&nbsp;you can suggest other items that should&nbsp;be&nbsp;on the system&nbsp;(see <strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor"><a href="/_why">Why Register?</a></strong><strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">).</strong></p>
