<p>
	Taking more than 10 years to research and develop, a small British team have put together a unique approach to search for industrial, domestic and personal products and services.
</p><p>
	This approach to finding what you want and locating suppliers is very fast and very direct. It is in fact what might be called the first <strong data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="strong">Direct Search Engine</strong>.
</p><p>
	The basis of <strong data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="strong">OKTicK</strong> is that all products and services stem from a Keyword. A <strong data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="strong">Keyword</strong> is the basic name for the item being searched for. For example if the item is a type of Table then the Keyword is “Tables" and items that stem from that are things like “Oak Tables", “Breakfast Tables" etc.
</p><p>
	The items you will find are, basically, what might be called “Generic". That means they are 'general' not 'proprietary' (there is provision to proprietary names within the system and this will develop).
</p><p>
	<strong data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="strong">OKTicK</strong> employs sophisticated methods to locate Suppliers for the products and services you find here.
<br><br></p><p>

	<strong data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="strong"><br>Adverts and Placement</strong>
</p><p>
	How to improve your business placement ('ranking') or get Adverts displayed on <strong data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="strong">OKTicK</strong> is described <strong data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="strong"><a href="/_suppliers">here</a></strong>.
</p><p>
	<strong data-verified="redactor" data-redactor-tag="strong"><br>Fees</strong>
</p><p>
	In some cases to improve or ensure placement a fee is charged. "How much" is totally driven by “market forces". There are no artificially set levels. What suppliers decide to pay is the only regulating factor. (Of course to simplify matters the amount has to be in multiples of the lowest permitted stake - currently £1/week).
