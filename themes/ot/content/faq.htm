</p>
<h4><strong>If I invest money in OKTicK can it be refunded?</strong></h4>
<p>On OKTicK we will give you, as a registered Supplier and on a 'once only' basis, Â£15 worth of advertising credits for you to try the system without risk. To claim this you will first be required to register your business. See Terms &amp; Conditions for all the specific information on this. Note you are not required to pay anything to have your legitimate products and services listed on OKTicK. Monetary payments are not refunded. Searchers never pay to use the OKTicK system.
</p>
<h4><strong>Can Suppliers be on OKTicK for free?</strong></h4>
<p>Yes. There is no charge for being on OKTicK. In some particular cases you may need to buy credits to use to improve the position on the resulting lists when the items or services you are selling are searched for.
</p>
<h4><strong>Is SEO ("Search Engine Optimisation") required on OKTicK?</strong></h4>
<p>"SEO" has spawned a whole industry. It is based on the idea that to get towards the top of the list on some search engines your website must be especially designed with attention to various factors including keywords and other content. This complexity is not needed on the OKTicK Search Engine. In fact merely registering can immediately boost a supplier up the list.
</p>
<h4><strong>Is it correct that OKTicK lists only Suppliers of the precise item searched for?</strong></h4>
<p>Yes, OKTicK is designed to do just this. Note: very occassionally, however, the design of some websites on the internet can deceive our automatic recognition software. But in such a case you will usually find other Suppliers on the list who <em><strong>do</strong></em> actually provide what is searched for.
</p>
<h4><strong>Why does OKTicK open Supplier's websites in a new window?</strong></h4>
<p>This is done so that if the 1st or 2nd etc website you open does not have precisely what you are looking for you can easily return to the listing and open a different website.
</p>
<h4><strong>Does OKTicK employ the "pay-per-click" system of charging Suppliers?</strong></h4>
<p>No. In the "pay-per-click" system the customer is charged a sum every time someone clicks on the link to them. With OKTicK when a Supplier pays to get a position on a list, they are charged that one single fee for the week, no matter how many Searchers click on the link to them. Much as would happen with Ads in newspapers or magazines.
</p>
<h4><strong>Does OKTicK track me on the Internet, for example to find my interests to make offers to me?</strong></h4>
<p>Absolutely not. OKTicK does not track any visitor after they leave the website in any way whatsoever. Only information the user wants us to keep a record of for them, like favourite items/suppliers, will be stored.
</p>
<h4><strong>What are the charges to Suppliers who wish to have good ranking based on?</strong></h4>
<p>Simply speaking charges are totally "market driven". This means whatever Suppliers are willing to pay to be ranked towards the top determines what needs to be paid. It is not arbitarily set by OKTicK. So in some cases to be on top constantly all you may need to do is Register!
</p>
<h4><strong>Why does OKTicK respond so quickly and accurately?</strong></h4>
<p>OKTicK has been researched in great depth for more than 10 years. It is in fact a new cross between the normal Search Engine and a Products &amp; Services Directory. This means it contains most of the common types of Products and Services that are commercially available. These are known as "Generic" or General names and it do not use proprietary names. A method of searching for these will be available in due course.
</p>
<h4><strong>The item I searched for does appear on OKTicK. Why is that and what can be done about it?</strong></h4>
<p>There are 2 reasons why specific Products or Services may not appear on OKTicK. It may be that no Suppliers have been found for it. In this case we are continuing to search for Suppliers that may deal with this. Note there are currently well over 1,000,000 active Suppliers on OKTicK. In some cases the item may have over-looked on the system. A method for Suppliers or Searchers to suggest items is under development. If the suggested item fits with OKTicK policy we will shortly add it to the system so Suppliers can be found for it. Also do not forget the very same item can appear with different names. Eg Cycle Pumps or Bicycle Pumps.
